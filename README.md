# A Beginner Exercise for CoderDojo (Silicon Valley) Student

### The goal of this exercise is to have students:

1. Write functionality to change the color of the page's text every time they click on a button

### Extras:

1. Modify the behavior so that clicking a button will change the text's color every 3 seconds
2. Add a button that when clicked will stop the text from changing color (until they click on the Change Color button again)
